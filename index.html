            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">We are facing unprecedented challenges – social, economic and
                environmental – driven by accelerating globalisation
                and a faster rate of technological developments. At the same time, those forces are providing us with
                myriad new
                opportunities for human advancement. The future is uncertain and we cannot predict it; but we need to be
                open and
                ready for it. The children entering education in 2018 will be young adults in 2030. Schools can prepare
                them for jobs
                that have not yet been created, for technologies that have not yet been invented, to solve problems that
                have not yet
                been anticipated. It will be a shared responsibility to seize opportunities and find solutions.
                To navigate through such uncertainty, students will need to develop curiosity, imagination, resilience
                and self[1]regulation; they will need to respect and appreciate the ideas, perspectives and values of
                others; and they will need to
                cope with failure and rejection, and to move forward in the face of adversity. Their motivation will be
                more than getting
                a good job and a high income; they will also need to care about the well-being of their friends and
                families, their
                communities and the planet</p>

            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">We are committed to helping every learner develop as a whole person,
                fulfil his or her potential and help shape a shared
                future built on the well-being of individuals, communities and the planet.
                Children entering school in 2018 will need to abandon the notion that resources are limitless and are
                there to be
                exploited; they will need to value common prosperity, sustainability and well-being. They will need to
                be responsible
                and empowered, placing collaboration above division, and sustainability above short-term gain.
                In the face of an increasingly volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world, education can make the
                difference as
                to whether people embrace the challenges they are confronted with or whether they are defeated by them.
                And in an era
                characterised by a new explosion of scientific knowledge and a growing array of complex societal
                problems, it is
                appropriate that curricula should continue to evolve, perhaps in radical ways</p>

            <p class="sectionTag text-big">Navigating through a complex and uncertain world</p>
            <p class="sectionsubTag text-small">Future-ready students need to exercise agency, in their own education
                and throughout life. Agency implies a sense of
                responsibility to participate in the world and, in so doing, to influence people, events and
                circumstances for the better.
                Agency requires the ability to frame a guiding purpose and identify actions to achieve a goal.
                To help enable agency, educators must not only recognise learners’ individuality, but also acknowledge
                the wider set of
                relationships – with their teachers, peers, families and communities – that influence their learning. A
                concept underlying
                the learning framework is “co-agency” – the interactive, mutually supportive relationships that help
                learners to progress
                towards their valued goals. In this context, everyone should be considered a learner, not only students
                but also teachers,
                school managers, parents and communities.
                Two factors, in particular, help learners enable agency. The first is a personalised learning
                environment that supports
                and motivates each student to nurture his or her passions, make connections between different learning
                experiences and
                opportunities, and design their own learning projects and processes in collaboration with others. The
                second is building
                a solid foundation: literacy and numeracy remain crucial. In the era of digital transformation and with
                the advent of big
                data, digital literacy and data literacy are becoming increasingly essential, as are physical health and
                mental well-being.
                OECD Education 2030 stakeholders have co-developed a “learning compass” that shows how young people can
                navigate their lives and their world</p>
